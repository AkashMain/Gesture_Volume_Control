# Gesture_Volume_Control
Control Volume by moving Hand gestures (OpenCV)

Here there are two basic and advance python codes to control volume of PC by increasing or decresing distance between first finger and thumb using hand tracking in OpenCV.


Both gesturehandcontrol(basic).py and geture_volume_control(advance).py supervise volume but gesture_volume_control(advance).py is more user friendly(here user can set 
volume only by closing third finger which provides more comfort to user and there will be no fluctuation of volume in this case) and give 100% accuracy.
